## Monitoring, Commissioning and Maintenance of the CMS Strip Tracker
CMS strip tracker is an important part of the CMS detector. It is built
at the innermost layer of the CMS detector, providing the tracks of particles
originating from the proton-proton collisions and assigning vertex that is
very important for physics analyses. Being very close to the interaction point,
it is exposed to very high radiation. In order to make sure that CMS detector
provides high quality data that is crucial for physics analyses, the tracker
needs to be monitored. We perform simulations of different detector properties
using the temperature and fluence history of the CMS strip tracker.
These simulations are then compared to real measurements to determine
the performance of the detector. We later use these simulations to estimate
detector lifetime, improve annealing, and temperature settings so that
the tracker will continue taking high quality data for a longer term.
These simulations are also important for testing models that are developed
from experimental studies and the results of our experimental studies
on prototype silicon detectors are directly applicable in this project.

## Search for Anomalous HVV Couplings
After the discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in 2012, 
the focus of interest now moved on to understanding the physics behind this particle,
in particular whether it is the Higgs boson as predicted by the standard model (SM)
or it has some theory beyond the SM. In order to find out if it is a Higgs
boson or the Higgs boson, we need to characterize its full properties such as spin and parity.
The studies showed that the new particle is a scalar particle with a spin of 0 as predicted by the SM. 
However, these results did not exclude very small anomalous couplings to other particles.
In this work, we search for anomalous Higgs couplings to vector bosons in VH associated
Higgs production channel with Higgs decaying to a pair of bottom quarks
and vector boson decaying leptonically using the data collected with the Compact
Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector at the LHC from proton-proton collisions in 2012 at center-of-mass energy
of $\sqrt{s}=8$ TeV. We demonstrated that the VH channel is very powerful to put limits
on very small anomalous Higgs couplings to vector bosons.
This analysis was the first study of anomalous Higgs couplings at the LHC in VH associated
Higgs production channel and the first study in Higgs fermionic decay channel.
The resulting paper is published in PLB and can be found at

## Radiation Hard Detectors for Phase-II Upgrade of CMS Detector
This project was a research into the development of radiation hard silicon sensors
to be used in the CMS tracker during the high luminosity phase of the LHC (HL-LHC).
Given the very high radiation environment with increased limunosity,
it is very crucial to develop new sensor technologies that would be suitable
in the presence of high radiation conditions during HL-LHC.
We have built experimental setups at Brown University to perform tests on prototype
silicon detectors and to investigate their radiation hardness.
We have studied many prototype sensors on these experimental setups both before
and after 800 MeV proton irradiations at LANSCE (Los Alamos National Lab).
We have also extended our studies by performing an isothermal annealing study at different temperatures.
The results of these studies helped understand more about the radiation damage
dependency on particle type (protons, neutrons, muons) and/or different energies (23MeV and 23GeV).
