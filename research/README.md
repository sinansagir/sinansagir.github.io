## Monitoring, Commissioning and Maintenance of the CMS Strip Tracker
CMS strip tracker is an important part of the CMS detector. It is built at the innermost layer of the CMS detector, providing the tracks of particles originating from the proton-proton collisions and assigning vertex that is very important for physics analyses. Being very close to the interaction point, it is exposed to very high radiation. In order to make sure that CMS detector provides high quality data that is crucial for physics analyses, the tracker needs to be monitored. We perform simulations of different detector properties using the temperature and fluence history of the CMS strip tracker. These simulations are then compared to real measurements to determine the performance of the detector. We later use these simulations to estimate detector lifetime, improve annealing, and temperature settings so that the tracker will continue taking high quality data for a longer term. These simulations are also important for testing models that are developed from experimental studies and the results of our experimental studies on prototype silicon detectors are directly applicable in this project.
