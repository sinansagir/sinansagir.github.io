# Sinan Sagir

I am an assistant professor of physics at KaramanoÄŸlu Mehmetbey University and
visiting faculty at Brown University. I work on experimental particle physics
in Compact Muon Selenoid ([CMS](https://cms.cern/)) experiment at [CERN](https://home.cern/). 
I have worked on searches for Higgs couplings ([1][]), vector-like quarks
([2][],[3][],[4][],[5][]), charged Higgs ([6][]), and production of four top quarks ([7][]). 

I should spend more time going on mountain hikes, camping, and experimenting with rock climbing.
