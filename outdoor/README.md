Büyük Demirkazık
==============

-   Elevation: 3.756m
-   Summit Date: October 28, 2024

Büyük Demirkazık is a mountain peak in Aladağlar mountain range. It is the second highest peak in this mountain range after Kızılkaya. This climb was part of 4 days / 3 nights activity that included plan to summit 3 peaks including Küçük Demirkazık, Büyük Demirkazık, and Davlumbaz. For this expedition, I joined a group called Summit Turkey. On October 26, 2024, I met the group in Çukurbağ village of Niğde. We had breakfast, put our stuff on a tractor and went to Arpalık plateau, where 4 horses were waiting for us to carry our stuff to Obayeri camping area. Büyük Demirkazık was the second summit of the activity after Küçük Demirkazık. We wake up around 5:30am and started hiking around 6:20am. We followed the classical route. We reached the shoulder through the East Scree and had our breakfast before starting the technical climb over the rock face. We reached the summit at around 2pm. After about 30 minutes on the summit, we started descending. After 2 pitches of down climb with rope, the sun set and it got dark. We had a few more pitches with technical descend and we had to do it in dark. We were able to reach the shoulder around 12:30am. There was still a long way down to go and it was cold and dark. Because the East Scree route was dangerous in the dark, we decided to take the Red Scree route to get to the Karayalak camping area, where they arranged a pick up to take us to Çukurbağ village. We finished descenging the Red Scree around 2:30am and started hiking through the valley. Around 4:30am we reached a point in the valley where there was a lot of snow that was dangerous to pass in the dark. Therefore, we decided to find ourselves shelter and wait for the dawn to break. We passed the snowy area after sun rise and reach the Karayalak samping area around 11am on October 29, 2024.

Küçük Demirkazık
==============

-   Elevation: 3.456m
-   Summit Date: October 27, 2024

Küçük Demirkazık is a mountain peak in Aladağlar mountain range. This climb was part of 4 days / 3 nights activity that included plan to summit 3 peaks including Küçük Demirkazık, Büyük Demirkazık, and Davlumbaz. For this expedition, I joined a group called Summit Turkey. On October 26, 2024, I met the group in Çukurbağ village of Niğde. We had breakfast, put our stuff on a tractor and went to Arpalık plateau, where 4 horses were waiting for us to carry our stuff to Obayeri camping area. We arrived just before sun set and immediately set up our camp before it is dark. It was very cold and I was only partly able to sleep during the night because of that. We wake up around 5:30am, get ready, and left around 6am for our first summit to Küçük Demirkazık. This summit requires technical climbing experience, which I did not have. It is even among the most difficult technical climbs in this region. We reached 3300 meters around 10am. Up to this point the climb was not very technical, but the rest of the climb was very technical and needed to set up ropes. Our guide (Emre Varol) did the first climb and set up the ropes on the route. However, after he finished the first pitch, he suggested that I do not climb the rest because of partial snows on the pitch and loose rocks. I complied as it didn't look like something I should do without prior experience. I waited the group there until they do the summet and return. We then returned back to our camp around 8pm after sun set. We had quick dinner and went to sleep to get rest before the next summit the next day. Luckily, the weather was warmer compared to first night and I was able to get good sleep.

Mount Erciyes
==============

-   Elevation: 3.917m
-   Summit Date: August 18, 2024

Mount Erciyes is an inactive volcano in Kayseri province, Türkiye. It is the highest mountain and volcano in Central Anatolia and the fifth highest peak in Türkiye. I climbed this mountain with a club (SEDAK) in Konya province. We left from Konya early in the morning on August 17, 2024 and arrived in Erciyes Ski Resort in the afternoon. We took the cable car to the cafe up the hill and from there we hiked around 2km with all of our gear including our camping gear. We set up our camp around 5pm, had our dinner and went to bed. We wake up around 1:30am and started hiking at 2am. We reached the summit around 8am, had breakfast, and started descending around 9:20am. We arrived back to our camp around 1pm.

Emler
==============

-   Elevation: 3.723m
-   Summit Date: July 21, 2024

Emler is the fourth highest peak within the Aladağlar mountain range (beloging to Taurus mountain range). I climbed this mountain together with a club (MEDIDAK) from Mersin. I arrived in Çamardı town of Niğde around noon on July 20, 2024 and met with the rest of the group. We had lunch and completed our supplies from the stores there. Then we went to Turkish Mountaineering Federation (TDF) training center. From there we switched to a tractor that took us to Karayalak camping area. We set up our camp, had dinner together, and went to sleep. We got up around 1:30am and started hiking around 2am. When we reached to Dinlenme Taşı (rest stone), dawn had just broken and it was very cold. I didn't want to rest long as my sweat was getting cold and I didn't have extra layers to put on. So, I let the others know and started to move ahead. I reached the summit around 9am and the rest of the group arrived around an hour later. The view on the summit was spectacular wtih all peaks of Aladağlar range visible. After spending about an hour on the summit (I spent 2 hours with early arrival) having breakfast, taking photos, etc., we headed back down to Karayalak camping area. I reached our camp around 3pm. Emler hike requires good physical and altitude fitness, but no technical climb is required.

Mount Aydos
==============

-   Elevation: 3.425m
-   Summit Date: June 30, 2024

Mount Aydos, the highest peak in Konya province and the second highest in the Bolkar mountain range (part of the Taurus range), is a prominent climbing destination in Türkiye. I joined a mountaineering group (SEDAK) for this climb, who planned to arrive early in the morning at around 2 a.m. and begin the hike immediately. I decided to arrive earlier to set up camp and rest before the climb.
On June 29, 2024, I reached Çakıllar village at around 7 p.m. Beyond the village, there’s an 8-kilometer gravel road leading to the trail base. After driving about 4 kilometers on this road, my car started experiencing issues. I decided to return to Çakıllar village to meet the group and travel with them to the trail base. Instead of setting up camp, I rested in my car while waiting for the group, who arrived at around 1:30 a.m. We reached the trail base together at approximately 2 a.m.
We started hiking immediately, following what is known as the ERDAK Club Route, though with some modifications. By 10 a.m., we reached the summit, where we were treated to breathtaking views of Mount Hasan, Mount Erciyes, Demirkazık, and Medetsiz in the distance. We spent about an hour and a half enjoying the scenery before starting our descent. We returned to the trail base at approximately 2:30 p.m.

Mount Hasan
==============

-   Elevation: 3.268m
-   Summit Date: June 9, 2024

Mount Hasan, a volcano located in Aksaray province, Türkiye, is a prominent peak in Anatolia. On June 8, 2024, I reached the mountain's base, where most hikes typically begin. This area features a hotel named Karbeyaz and several camping spots. I arrived at around 9 p.m., set up my camp, and went to sleep early, as I planned to join a hiking group (SEDAK) that was scheduled to arrive at 2 a.m. and start the hike immediately.
We began the hike between 2:30 and 3 a.m., initially following the classical route. However, just below a rock structure called Damlataş, we deviated from the usual trail that winds through scree and instead ascended directly. This route was slightly precarious due to patches of snow and loose rocks.
We reached the summit between 9 and 10 a.m., taking in the breathtaking views. For the descent, we followed the classical route and arrived back at the camp at around 3 p.m.

Mount Özyurt (Hacıbaba)
==============

-   Elevation: 2.481m
-   Summit Date: January 6, 2024

Özyurt Mountain (also known as Hacıbaba) is the highest peak in Karaman province, Türkiye. Before my successful climb, I made two prior attempts, both of which were unsuccessful.
The first attempt was on October 28, 2023, but I had to abandon the hike due to a family emergency. The second attempt took place on November 11, 2023. We began the hike around noon, but as we approached the summit, it became clear that it would get dark before we could complete the climb. Reluctantly, we decided to turn back approximately 500 meters below the summit.
On January 6, 2024, I decided to make a third attempt, this time solo. I successfully reached the summit at around 3:30 p.m. Unfortunately, it got dark half way down and I was descending along a different trail down than the one I had taken up. While the trail wasn’t technical, it was rocky, and my physical fitness wasn’t adequate for such a challenging hike. By the time I finished, my legs were trembling, I struggled to sit for several days, and my toes were covered in blisters.
Although the elevation of Özyurt Mountain isn’t particularly high and the climb isn’t technical, it does demand a good level of physical fitness—especially for the route I chose. That said, there are alternative, easier trails available for summiting this peak.

Mount Dedegöl
==============

-   Elevation: 2.998m
-   Summit Date: August 31, 2019

Mount Dedegöl is the highest peak in the Central Taurus mountain range, located in Isparta province, Türkiye. Originally, I planned to summit the peak solo, but at the last moment, I decided to bring my nephew along.
This was my first attempt at climbing a mountain of this height. Although it didn’t require technical climbing skills, I underestimated the challenge, believing we could complete the climb with ease. Unfortunately, we made a critical mistake right from the start: we didn't carry enough water.
We began our ascent around 9 a.m. and reached the summit by approximately 1 p.m., but we had already run out of water on the way up. On the descent, we made another poor decision to go off-trail, hoping to find water. However, the terrain became increasingly difficult and led us farther from our base camp at Melikler Plateau. On top of that, we couldn’t locate any water sources.
Thankfully, we encountered a shepherd family who generously provided us with water and tea. They also had guests with an off-road truck who were kind enough to offer us a ride back to our base camp.
In the trail I recorded below, Melikler Plateau is visible in the far distance to the left of my right hand. The last 7 kilometers of the trail were recorded during the off-road truck ride back.
