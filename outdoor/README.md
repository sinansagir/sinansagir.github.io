Mount Dedegöl
==============

-   Elevation: 2.998m
-   Summit Date: August 31, 2019

Mount Dedegöl is the  highest peak in the Central Taurus mountains, located in Isparta province in Türkiye.
I was originally planning to summit this peak alone, but at the last moment I took my nephew with me.
This was going to be my first climb of a mountain this high, but still I thought we could make this climb easily as it didn't require any technical skill.
This was a mistake from the beginning as we didn't take enough water with us.
We started around 9am and reached the summit at around 1pm. However, we had already run out of water on the way up.
Then we made the second mistake and went off-trail in the hopes that we find water on the way down.
The off-trail became very difficult, went away from our camp as we descended, and didn't find any water. 
We were however lucky to run into a shepherd family who provided us water.
They also had some guests with offroad truck, who were going to pass by our base camp in Melikler Plateau and were happy to give us a lift.
In the trail that I recorded,
