Legend:

- Blue: lectures
- Dark red and green: labs
- Grey: deadlines
- Purple: quizzes
- Brown: office hours and other academic activities
- Orange: extracurricular activities/events


Note: you can click the small arrow in the upper-right to turn off certain calendars (like lab sections you're not in). You can also import these calendars directly into your own Google Calendar by clicking the `+` at the lower-right of the calendar. If so, we suggest importing all calendars except for lab sections you're not in. After importing, you may need to select this calendar for sync [here](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/syncselect).
